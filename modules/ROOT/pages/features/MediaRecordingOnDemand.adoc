:description: SIP3 Media Recording On Demand.

== Overview

Here is an example of the SIP3 `Media Quality Widget` which helps to classify most of the problems within just a few seconds:

However, there are some situations where detailed quality analysis is still required. In such situations, VoIP engineers usually have to capture an entire call session (including RTP streams) and analyze it in Wireshark manually.

Often case, capturing an entire call session is not an easy thing because of the amount of servers and VoIP traffic. To automate it and provide a better user experience the SIP3 team designed and implemented `Media Recording On Demand` feature.

Let's see how you can configure a set of filters to capture entire call session (including RTP streams in `FULL` or `GDPR` modes) and analyze it later in Wireshark.

== Usage

Here is an example of `recording.yml` file with `Media Recording On Demand` configured:

[source,yaml]
----
recording:
  enabled: true
  filters:
    - filter: "sip.src_addr=26.03.19.93 sip.user=desi"                        // <1>
      mode : 0                                                                // <2>
    - filter: "rtp.host=RTP_ENGINE_1 rtp.r_factor<75 rtp.duration>10000"      // <3>
      mode : 1                                                                // <4>

----

<1> SIP signaling filter that enables recording of session from `26.03.19.93` and to or from user `desi`.
<2> `FULL` mode. In this mode SIP3 will record full RTP packets including voice payload.
<3> Media quality filter that enables recording of Media sessions with host `RTP_ENGINE_1`, R-Factor calculated from RTP less that 75 and duration of RTP stream more than 10000ms (10 seconds)
<4> `GDPR` mode. In this mode SIP3 will record only headers of RTP packets without voice payload.

WARNING: `Recording on Demand` filters from files will no longer supported be once this feature is added to the SIP3 UI.

Now more about filters.

== Filters

The `Media Recording On Demand` feature support two types of filters:

1. `Signaling filters` - applied at the codec negotiation phase.
2. `Media filters` - applied to each periodic RTP Report handled by `Salto`.

Configuration of `Media Recording On Demand` may contain multiple filters of both types. SIP3 loads and uses filters in the order defined in configuration. The first matching filter's recording mode will be applied to matched Call/Media session.

=== Modes

Each filter controls a `Media Recording Mode`. SIP3 supports `FULL` and `GDPR` modes:

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Mode |Value |Description

|`FULL`
|`0`
|Full RTP/RTCP and related ICMP packets with the voice payload included.

|`GDPR`
|`1`
|Only headers of RTP/RTCP and related ICMP packets without the voice payload.
|===

In addition to GDPR compliance `GDPR` mode also requires way less storage space (economy is about 75%).

NOTE: Recording Mode can't be overridden for the same Media Session.

=== Expressions

Each filter consists of one or more attributes expressions (similar to what you could see in the xref::features/AdvancedSearch.adoc#_expressions[`Advanced Search` document]) separated with a space. Attributes expressions are very simple syntactic constructions:
```
<attribute><operator><value>
```

SIP3 supports 3 main attributes types: `String`, `Boolean`, `Number`. In meantime each of the types support a certain list of operators:

|===
|Operator | Types | Description

| `=`
| `String`, `Boolean`, `Number`
| Equals

| `!=`
| `String`, `Boolean`, `Number`
| Not equals

| `>`
| `Number`
| More than

| `<`
| `Number`
| Less than

| `=~`
| `String`
| Regular expression
|===

NOTE: A filter is matched when all attributes expressions are `True`.
