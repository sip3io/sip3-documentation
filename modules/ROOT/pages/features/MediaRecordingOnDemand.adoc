:description: SIP3 Media Recording On Demand.

== Overview

Here is an example of the SIP3 `Media Quality Widget` which helps to classify most of the problems within just a few seconds:

However, there are some situations where detailed quality analysis is still required. In such situations, VoIP engineers usually have to capture an entire call session (including RTP streams) and analyze it in Wireshark manually.

Often case, capturing an entire call session is not an easy thing because of the amount of servers and VoIP traffic. To automate it and provide a better user experience the SIP3 team designed and implemented `Media Recording On Demand` feature.

Let's see how you can configure a set of filters to capture entire call session (including RTP streams in `FULL` or `GDPR` modes) and analyze it later in Wireshark.

== Usage

Here is an example of `recording.yml` file with `Media Recording On Demand` configured:

[source,yaml]
----
recording:
  enabled: true
  filters:
    - filter: "ip.src_addr=26.03.19.93 sip.user=desi"                         // <1>
      mode : 0                                                                // <2>
    - filter: "ip.host=RTP_ENGINE_1 media.r_factor<75 media.duration>10000"   // <3>
      mode : 1                                                                // <4>

----

<1> SIP signaling filter that enables recording for session from `26.03.19.93` to or from user `desi`.
<2> `FULL` mode. In this mode SIP3 will record full RTP packets including voice payload.
<3> Media quality filter that enables recording for Media sessions with host `RTP_ENGINE_1`, R-Factor less that 75 and duration of media more than 10000ms (10 seconds)
<4> `GDPR` mode. In this mode SIP3 will record only headers of RTP packets without voice payload.

Now more about filters.

== Filters

There are two types of filters in `SIP3` for `Media Recording On Demand`:

1. `SIP signaling filter` - applying at Codec negotiation.
2. `Media quality filter` - applying on each periodic RTP Report handled by `Salto`.

Configuration of `Media Recording On Demand` may contain multiple filters both of types. All filters will be loaded to `SIP3` and checking in order from configuration. The first matching filter's recording mode will be applied to matched Call/Media session.

=== Expressions

Each Filter contains one or more `Expression` separated with `Space`. `Expression` has simple structure `<attribute><operator><value>`:

- `<attribute>` - an Attribute whose value need to be checked.
- `<operator>` - an Expression operator.
- `<value>` - what the value will be compared to.

Attributes may be `String`, `Boolean`, `Integer` or `Float` type. Available operators for Attribute depends on its value type.
Filter is matched when all Expressions will be `True`.
