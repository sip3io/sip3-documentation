:description: SIP3 Advanced Search.

== Overview

`Advanced Search` is a very minimalistic user interface which calls at the same time a very powerful SIP3 search API. Its syntax was inspired by Wireshark filters and includes three main groupings of search attributes: `sip`, `rtp` and `rtcp`. Selected time range plus one or many search attributes, turned into search attributes expressions, connected via logical `AND` operator represent a SIP3 query:

== Search Attributes Expressions

Search attributes expressions is a very simple syntactic constructions:
```
<attribute><operator><value>
```

SIP3 supports 3 main attributes types: `String`, `Boolean` and `Number`. In meantime each of the types support a certain list of operators:

|===
|Operator | Types | Description

| `=`
| `String`, `Boolean`, `Number`
| Equals

| `!=`
| `String`, `Boolean`, `Number`
| Not equals

| `>`
| `Number`
| More than

| `<`
| `Number`
| Less than

| `=~`
| `String`
| Regular expression
|===

If search attribute has finite amount of possible values (as for instance any `Boolean` or some `String` attributes do) all its values will be shown in a dropdown menu:

Otherwise, you can just write anything as its value:

== Groupings

=== `sip`

As you already got it the `sip` grouping is a set of attributes corresponding to the SIP protocol. The `sip` grouping consists of 25 default search attributes but could be easily extended with xref:tutorials/HowToInroduceUserDefinedAttribute.adoc[User-Defined Attributes].
