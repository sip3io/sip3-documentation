:description: SIP3 Advanced Search.

== Overview

`Advanced Search` is a very minimalistic user interface to a very powerful SIP3 search API. Its syntax was inspired by Wireshark filters and includes three main groupings of search attributes: `sip`, `rtp` and `rtcp`. `Advanced Search` input represents a SIP3 query which consists of selected time range and one or many search attributes expressions connected via logical `AND` operator:

== Expressions

Search attributes expressions are very simple syntactic constructions:
```
<attribute><operator><value>
```

SIP3 supports 3 main attributes types: `String`, `Boolean` and `Number`. In meantime each of the types support a certain list of operators:

|===
|Operator | Types | Description

| `=`
| `String`, `Boolean`, `Number`
| Equals

| `!=`
| `String`, `Boolean`, `Number`
| Not equals

| `>`
| `Number`
| More than

| `<`
| `Number`
| Less than

| `=~`
| `String`
| Regular expression
|===

If search attribute has finite amount of possible values (as for instance any `Boolean` or some `String` attributes do) all its values will be shown in a dropdown menu:

Otherwise, you can just write anything as its value:

== Groupings

As it was mentioned above every SIP3 query is a combination of multiple search attributes expressions. And here you have no limitations. Feel free to combine as many attributes as you need. They also can be from different groupings like `"sip.caller=plami rtp.r_factor<30"`. There is only one thing you need to account for:

IMPORTANT: Queries `"sip.caller=plami rtp.r_factor<30"` and `"rtp.r_factor<30 sip.caller=plami"` are not the same because SIP3 uses different database collections for signaling and media data indexes. It's up to you to decide which one of these queries will be faster.

=== `"sip"` attributes

As you already got it the `sip` grouping is a set of attributes corresponding to the SIP protocol. The `sip` grouping consists of 25 default search attributes but could be easily extended with xref::features/UserDefinedFunctions.adoc#_user_defined_attributes[User-Defined Attributes].

|===
|Attribute |Type |Description

| `sip.addr`
| `String`
| Source or destination IP address. Virtual attribute which helps to cover queries like `sip.src_addr=127.0.0.1 or sip.dst_addr=127.0.0.1`

| `sip.src_addr`
| `String`
| Source IP address

| `sip.dst_addr`
| `String`
| Destination IP address

| `sip.host`
| `String (with options)`
| Source or destination host. Virtual attribute which helps to cover queries like `sip.src_host=PBX-1 or sip.dst_host=PBX-1`

| `sip.src_host`
| `String (with options)`
| Source host

| `sip.dst_host`
| `String (with options)`
| Destination host

| `sip.user`
| `String`
| `From` or `To` SIP headers user. Virtual attribute which helps to cover queries like `sip.caller=plami or sip.callee=plami`

| `sip.caller`
| `String`
| `From` SIP header user. Take into account that `sip.caller` might be re-assigned within a xref::features/UserDefinedFunctions.adoc#_service_attributes[User-Defined Function]

| `sip.callee`
| `String`
| `To` SIP header user. Take into account that `sip.callee` might be re-assigned within a xref::features/UserDefinedFunctions.adoc#_service_attributes[User-Defined Function]

| `sip.method`
| `String(with options)`
| SIP method. Helps to optimize your search request performance by querying corresponding data only

| `sip.call_id`
| `String`
| `Call-ID` SIP header

| `sip.state`
| `String(with options)`
| Call, registration or transaction state. For instance, possible call states are `unknown`, `redirected`, `answered`, `canceled` and `failed`

| `sip.error_code`
| `String(with options)`
| Last SIP session's transaction error code

| `sip.error_type`
| `String(with options)`
| Last SIP session's transaction error type: `client`, `server` or `global`

| `sip.duration`
| `Number`
| SIP call duration in milliseconds

| `sip.trying_delay`
| `Number`
| Time in milliseconds between SIP INVITE request and corresponding 100 SIP response

| `sip.setup_time`
| `Number`
| Time in milliseconds between SIP INVITE request and corresponding 18x SIP response

| `sip.cancel_time`
| `Number`
| Time in milliseconds between SIP INVITE request and corresponding 487 SIP response

| `sip.establish_time`
| `Number`
| Time in milliseconds between SIP INVITE request and corresponding 200 SIP response

| `sip.disconnect_time`
| `Number`
| Time in milliseconds between SIP BYE request and corresponding 200 SIP response

| `sip.transactions`
| `Number`
| Amount of SIP transactions

| `sip.retransmits`
| `Number`
| Amount of SIP retransmits

| `sip.terminated_by`
| `String(with options)`
| Party terminated SIP session: `caller` or `callee`

| `sip.overlapped_interval`
| `Number`
| Difference in milliseconds between a time when REGISTER session is supposed be expired and a time when renewal SIP REGISTER message came. Helps to find SIP user agents who ignore `Expiration` SIP header contract

| `sip.overlapped_fraction`
| `Number`
| `sip.overlapped_interval` ratio. Helps to find SIP user agents who ignore `Expiration` SIP header contract

| `sip.my_custom_attribute`
| `String(with or without options)`, `Boolean`
| Custom xref::features/UserDefinedFunctions.adoc#_user_defined_attributes[User-Defined Attributes]

=== `"rtp"` and `"rtcp"` attributes

It doesn't make sense to separate `rtp` and `rtcp` groupings definition because after all both groupings have the same set of attributes. The only one difference between these two - is a source of data: RTP or RTCP protocols.

|===
|Attribute |Type |Description

| `rtp.addr`, `rtcp.addr`
| `String`
| Source or destination IP address. Virtual attribute which helps to cover queries like `sip.src_addr=127.0.0.1 or sip.dst_addr=127.0.0.1`

| `rtp.src_addr`, `rtcp.src_addr`
| `String`
| Source IP address

| `rtp.dst_addr`, `rtcp.dst_addr`
| `String`
| Destination IP address

| `rtp.host`, `rtcp.host`
| `String (with options)`
| Source or destination host. Virtual attribute which helps to cover queries like `sip.src_host=PBX-1 or sip.dst_host=PBX-1`

| `rtp.src_host`, `rtcp.src_host`
| `String (with options)`
| Source host

| `rtp.dst_host`, `rtcp.dst_host`
| `String (with options)`
| Destination host

| `rtp.mos`, `rtcp.mos`
| `Number`
| Mean Opinion Score. Always stays in from 0 to 5 range

| `rtp.r_factor`, `rtcp.r_factor`
| `Number`
| R-Factor. Always stays in from 0 to 100 range

| `rtp.codec`, `rtcp.codec`
| `String (with options)`
| Codec used for media data processing

| `rtp.bad_report_fraction`, `rtcp.bad_report_fraction`
| `Number`
| During a media session participants generate and send multiple RTCP messages. Each of the messages represents a single report. This metric helps to find media sessions with problems during entire time of the session

| `rtp.one_way`, `rtcp.one_way`
| `Boolean`
| Helps to find one-way media streams

| `rtp.duration`, `rtcp.duration`
| `Number`

== History of Searches

It happens that we can go into wrong direction while troubleshooting a particular problem. In such cases it might be good to be able to get a few steps back. That's why `Advanced Search` has a history of searches section:

== Conclusions

Now when you know how to use `Advanced Search` let's take a look at xref::features/CallDetails.adoc[Call Details] section.
