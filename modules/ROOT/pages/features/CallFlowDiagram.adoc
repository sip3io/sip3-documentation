The diagram visualizes cryptic information about the call and represents it as a combination of call events between participants.

== Events
Both `SIP Events` and `Media Events` are placed in chronological order.

NOTE: Keep in mind, that each `Media Event` stay in place on scroll between its start and finish timestamp in the call.

=== SIP Events
Each `SIP Event` has short info about its method and timestamp. If you hover a `SIP Event`, all sip events, that belongs to the same transaction highlights.

Each `SIP Event` timestamp is clickable and cycles through `Absolute`, `Delta` and `Relative` time on each mouse click.

NOTE: There is another way to change timestamps settings from call flow sidebar menu, and it's discussed later in this manual.

=== Media Events
Each `Media Event` has info about its codecs and r-factor value.
