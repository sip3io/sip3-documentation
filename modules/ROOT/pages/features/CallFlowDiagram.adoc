== Overview
Here is an example of the SIP3 `Call Flow Diagram` which allows to analyze a call as a sequence diagram. It's the key feature of a xref:features/CallFlowDiagram.adoc[Call Details Widget].

The diagram visualizes cryptic information about the call and represents it as a combination of call events between participants.

=== Events
Both `SIP Events` and `Media Events` are placed in chronological order.

NOTE: Keep in mind, that each `Media Event` stay in place on scroll between its start and finish timestamp in the call.

==== SIP Events
Each `SIP Event` has short info about its method and timestamp.

The more detailed info is shown on event click and looks like this:

Each `SIP Event` timestamp is clickable and cycles through `Absolute`, `Delta` and `Relative` time on each mouse click.

NOTE: There is another way to change timestamps settings from call flow sidebar menu, and it's discussed later in this manual.

==== Media Events
Each `Media Event` has info about its codecs and r-factor value.

The xref:features/MediaRecordingOnDemand.adoc[Media Quality Widget] is shown on event click.
