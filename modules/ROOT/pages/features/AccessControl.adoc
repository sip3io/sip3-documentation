= Access Control
:description: SIP3 Access control.

== Overview

To offer security and access control in SIP3 was developed and implemented Role-based access control model. SIP3 supports OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 Identity Providers like https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak].

== Security Roles

There are 5 predefined roles in SIP3:

<1> [[SIP3_UNAUTHORIZED]] `SIP3_UNAUTHORIZED`
<2> [[SIP3_VIEWER]]`SIP3_VIEWER`
<3> [[SIP3_SUPPORT]]`SIP3_SUPPORT`
<4> [[SIP3_SUPERVISOR]]`SIP3_SUPERVISOR`
<5> [[SIP3_ADMIN]]`SIP3_ADMIN`

These roles can grant access for support users to search and view SIP sessions, enable xref:features/MediaRecordingOnDemand.adoc[Media Recording On Demand] and deny access to setting up and editing the system. System administrators will also have access to configuration and management of SIP3 components, advanced Media Recording functionality, etc.
