= Installation

_If your distribution has a python-docker package, install it before starting the installation._

*Instructions for minimum installation:*

1. Open the repository with the ansible files: https://github.com/sip3io/sip3-ansible/tree/master/playbooks/trial
2. Docker container installation

[%hardbreaks]
Run ansible-playbook sip3-backend.yml to install the traffic collection agent
Run ansible-playbook sip3-captain.yml to install SIP3 application

Verify that all containers have been deployed using the command:

[%hardbreaks]
docker image ls


3. Next, you need to add all the ip addresses of your host to the database:

[%hardbreaks]
docker exec -it sip3-mongodb mongo
use sip3
db.hosts.insert({"name" : "SoftSwitch", "sip": ["209.253.93.85", "10.10.0.1"]})
