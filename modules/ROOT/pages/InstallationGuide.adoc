= Installation

_If your distribution has a python-docker package, install it before starting the installation._

*Instructions for minimum installation:*

1. Open the repository with the ansible files: https://github.com/sip3io/sip3-ansible/tree/master/playbooks/trial

2. Configure captain:
    View and edit file `roles/sip3-captain/templates/application.yml.j2`

3. Docker container installation

    Run `ansible-playbook sip3-backend.yml` to install the traffic collection agent

    Run `ansible-playbook sip3-captain.yml` to install SIP3 application

    Verify that all containers have been deployed using the command:

    `docker image ls`

4. Next, you need to add all the ip addresses of your host to the database:

    docker exec -it sip3-mongodb mongo
    use sip3
    db.hosts.insert({"name" : "SoftSwitch", "sip": ["209.253.93.85", "10.10.0.1"]})
