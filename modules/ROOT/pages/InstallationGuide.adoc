:description: SIP3 Installation Guide

== Overview

WARNING: This document is `work in progress`.
For instance, at the moment `sip3-ansible` has no support for `all.hosts.backend` property.
Still, you can use this document to get an idea of how to deploy the product using `sip3-ansible`.
In case of any problems we recommend you to compare configuration with the https://github.com/sip3io/sip3-ansible/blob/master/inventories/inventory.yml[default invetory file] or ask us a question in the SIP3 community channels.

SIP3 leverages a traditional microservice architecture that makes it easy to scale, in the cloud and on-premise.

Having each one of the SIP3 components deployed independently saves you money, time and resources, but it also brings a layer of extra complexity to the deployment process.
To make your life easier the SIP3 team introduced the https://github.com/sip3io/sip3-ansible[`sip3-ansible`] Github project.

NOTE: At the moment you can use `sip3-ansible` to deploy each of the SIP3 components as a service to CentOS, Debian or as a docker container to any Linux OS.
Please, contact mailto:support@sip3.io[the SIP3 team] if you need help with specific environment.

By following the traditional Ansible approach, you will be creating an inventory file that describes the SIP3 installation process.
By doing so, you will be able to quickly deploy your project to any infrastructure, regardless of the size and amount of its traffic.

NOTE: The `sip3-ansible` project requires Ansible version 2.9 or higher.

== Basic Installation

In the following section we will deploy SIP3 to a simple VoIP network, consisting of one PBX server, as shown on the diagram below.
In the beginning SIP3 Captain will be installed as an agent to the same server.
Afterwards, all the SIP3 backend components will be installed to another server as a monolithic application.

=== Installing SIP3 Captain To Single PBX

Clone `sip3-ansible` repository and checkout the latest release branch:

[source,ssh]
----
git clone https://github.com/sip3io/sip3-ansible.git -b release/20XX.X.X (20XX.X.X - current release)
----

Create a `sip3-captain.yml` file inside the `inventories` directory:

[source,yaml]
----
all:
  hosts:
    captain:
      ansible_host: 23.08.20.15                       // <1>
  vars:
    ansible_user: root
    ansible_port: 22
    ansible_become: true

    platform: centos                                  // <2>
    edition: ce
    version: 2021.2.3

    features:                                         // <3>
      - rtcp

    captain:
      pcap:                                           // <4>
        dev: eth0
        bpf_filter: udp
      sender:                                         // <5>
        uri: udp://192.168.1.2:15060
      management:                                     // <6>
        uri: udp://192.168.1.2:15090
      metrics:
        logging:
          step: 5000
----

Let's take a closer look at the inventory file:

<1> SSH address.
Ansible uses it to connect to the PBX via SSH.

<2> Platform and the component version.
At the moment you can choose between `centos` and `docker` platforms.

<3> Features help to customize SIP3 behaviour and enable/disable certain functionality.
They also help to separate CE and EE configuration.
You can find more information in the corresponding section of this document.

<4> Standard `libpcap` settings.
Specify on which interface you want to capture VoIP traffic and set https://biot.com/capstats/bpf.html[BPF filter] to avoid capturing all the packets (e.g. If you want to capture only SIP protocol on port 5060 use `udp and port 5060` as a filter).

<5> SIP3 Salto data interface.
SIP3 Captain uses this interface to send application data.

<6> Management interface.
Must be defined if `rtp` or `rtcp` features enabled.
SIP3 Salto and Captain use this interface to exchange SDP information.

Our minimalistic SIP3 Captain configuration is ready.
Now, let's install SIP3 Captain to the PBX using the command below:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventories/sip3-captain.yml playbooks/sip3.yml
```

Once Ansible successfully finished with the playbook we can check that SIP3 Captain is actually working.
At the first check bootstrap information from `/var/log/sip3-captain/default.log` if you deployed SIP3 Captain without Docker or `~/sip3/var/log/sip3-captain/default.log` in other case:

```
05-10-2020 11:36:34.758 [vert.x-eventloop-thread-0] INFO  i.s.captain.ce.capturing.PcapEngine - Listening network interface: eth0
05-10-2020 11:36:34.885 [vert.x-eventloop-thread-1] INFO  io.sip3.captain.ce.sender.Sender - UDP connection opened: udp://192.168.1.2:15060
```

Now let's check `/var/log/sip3-captain/metrics.log` and `~/sip3/var/log/sip3-captain/metrics.log` accordingly to get some insights on the amount of traffic captured by SIP3 Captain and to make sure that the traffic goes to the SIP3 Salto:

```
05-10-2020 12:27:09.298 - packets_captured{name=sip3-captain,source=pcap} throughput=2.4/s
05-10-2020 12:27:09.299 - packets_sent{name=sip3-captain} throughput=1.2/s
```

Congratulations, SIP3 Captain is up and capturing traffic.
So, we can move to the next section of the document.

=== Installing SIP3 Captain To Multiple PBXs

In the previous section we configured SIP3 Captain for single PBX. However, in real life we usually have multiple VoIP nodes.

Let's add another PBX to our previous example and define a group of hosts called `captain` as it's shown in the example below:

[source,yaml]
----
all:
  children:
    captain:
      hosts:
        pbx1:
          ansible_host: 23.08.20.15
        pbx2:
          ansible_host: 29.11.19.88
          platform: docker                            // <1>
          captain:
            pcap:
              dev: eth1
  vars:
    ansible_user: root
    ansible_port: 22
    ansible_become: true

    platform: centos
    edition: ce
    version: 2021.2.3

    features:
      - rtcp

    captain:
      pcap:
        dev: eth0
        bpf_filter: udp
      sender:
        uri: udp://192.168.1.2:15060
      management:
        uri: udp://192.168.1.2:15090
      metrics:
        logging:
          step: 5000
----

<1> Each SIP3 Captain instance can be configured separately by re-assigning global variables withing the host section.
Re-assigned variables will be merged with the global one accordingly to https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable[Ansible precedence convention].

Now we can use the same command from the previous section to install both SIP3 Captains:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventories/sip3-captain.yml playbooks/sip3.yml
```

As you can see installing multiple SIP3 Captains as easy as installing one.

=== Uninstalling SIP3 Captain

To uninstall SIP3 Captain use the command bellow.
Please, take a look at additional `extra-vars` parameter:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventories/sip3-captain.yml playbooks/sip3.yml --extra-vars "state=absent"
```

=== Installing SIP3 Backend Components

Let's create a `sip3-backend.yml` file inside the `inventories` directory in analogy with what we've done in the <<Installing SIP3 Captain To Single PBX, previous section>>:

[source,yaml]
----
all:
  hosts:
    backend:
      ansible_host: 26.03.19.23                       // <1>

  vars:
    ansible_user: root
    ansible_port: 22
    ansible_become: true

    platform: centos                                  // <2>
    edition: ce
    version: 2021.2.3

    features:                                         // <3>
      - call
      - register
      - rtcp

    mongodb:                                          // <4>
      version: 4.2
      path: /var/lib/mongodb
      db: sip3
    influxdb:                                         // <5>
      path: /var/lib/influxdb
      db: sip3
    grafana:                                          // <6>
      datasources:
        database: sip3
    salto:
      server:                                         // <7>
        uri: udp://0.0.0.0:15060
      management:
        uri: udp://0.0.0.0:15090                      // <8>
----

Let's take a closer look at the inventory file:

<1> SSH address.
Ansible uses it to connect to the SIP3 backend via SSH.

<2> Platform and the component version.
At the moment you can choose between `centos` and `docker` platforms.

<3> Features help to customize SIP3 behaviour and enable/disable certain functionality.
They also help to separate CE and EE configuration.
You can find more information in the corresponding section of this document.

<4> MongoDB section where you can put a specific version, path and name of the database.

<5> InfluxDB section where you can put a specific version, path and name of the database.

<6> Grafana section where you can configure `sip3` datasource.

<7> SIP3 Salto data interface.
SIP3 Captain uses this interface to send application data.

<8> Management interface.
Must be defined if `rtp` or `rtcp` features enabled.
SIP3 Salto and Captain use this interface to exchange SDP information.

As you can see our default configuration file is pretty small and simple.
However, there are lots of additional properties we will explore in further sections of this document.
Now let's install SIP3 backend components by running the same simple command:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventories/sip3-backend.yml playbooks/sip3.yml
```

This document will be updated soon...
